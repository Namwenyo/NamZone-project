This project is part of the CMP3821 Network Systems Security mini project at UNAM. It focuses on building a secure website for NamZone, a local Namibian platform for buying and selling second-hand goods. The website allows sellers to list items and supports item verification before public display. This is the frontend and backend portion of the solution, which was then later integrated into a secure server infrastructure.
